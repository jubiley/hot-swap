# hot-swap
I am a team member of ProSys IT specialists and AT&amp;T engineers, having the
expertise in configuration for deployment of Apple iPhones, iPads, Panasonic
ToughPads and Toughbooks to AT&amp;T managers, technicians, &amp; customers. I
have hand-on experience and been well trained on several other AT&amp;T products
and services: security camera systems, Motorola scanners and Xplore
Technologies Tablets.

Utilizing my programming skills, Iâ€™ve developed, utilized and
integrated VBA scripts in the Hot-Swap systems at Itasca AT&amp;T Depot,
automating the whole swapping process from receiving to fulfilling requests from
clients.
